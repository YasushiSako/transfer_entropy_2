Data files:
Time courses for protein translocation in single cells are recorded in csv format. In each file, the first column indicates times (min) of
EGF stimulation. The second and after columns indicate signal intensities in single cells at the indicated time points. The first row shows
the cell indiex, and the SOS and RAF responses with the same index were obtained simultaneously in the same cell.
These data are lisensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.
